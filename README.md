# LTPS üòÇ

LTPS is a small Pixel Worlds private server project created by "efeciq." 
The code is filled with ChatGPT-generated snippets and contributions from others like ZKEVZ and DEERUX. 
Efeciq is now selling it for $5 (He changed price few times), which is the very definition of scamming, as anyone can see that this code lacks significant original contributions from this person. Despite this, efeciq still claims he spent a lot of time on it ("cuz idk I spent too much time for this project before"), which is a complete lie. Anyway, enjoy this small "leak" and don't listen to any PWPS developers or purchase their stuff. As far as I know, every so-called developer in the Pixel Worlds community is a fraud, a copy-paster, and relies solely on GPT, like Jim, Dude (aka Kela), Nekto, Jamsandwicher, Airbronze, Zeppy, CodeSpark, and many other developers related to Pixel Worlds.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è
Thanks to the people who provided me with this source for the leak. Enjoy your botting problems, CWPS, PWPS, Nekto (I hope you will leave public releases and keep this piss of shits as private) and keep your eyes open for me Project Reboot I hope this project will never get released. 
Keep claiming you can patch this ‚Äî OF COURSE, you can't. Maybe someday you'll figure out who I really am, but for now, I'll keep my real username private. Also, f#ck you NF (aka Neckflipper) for claiming my stuff. 
Keep running your mouth with your pseudo-DDOS skills and trying to sell methods for patching bots üòÇ. 
All you can do is steal other people's work, DDOS random targets, and make baseless claims. If you were a real DDOS'er, you'd go after people like me instead of pretending to be something you're not.
